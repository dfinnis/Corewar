# Corewar

[Core War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War) is a 1984 programming game in which two or more fighting programs compete for control of a virtual computer.

The goal of this project was to create:

* A Champion (fighting program), written in assembly.

* An Assembler ```asm```, which compiles the champion assembly into bytecode.

* A Virtual Machine ```corewar```, the battle arena where champions battle.

#### Final Score 125/100
